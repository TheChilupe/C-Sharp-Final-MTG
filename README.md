# C-Sharp-Final-MTG
Final Project focused on creating a card shop owner solution to automatically update stock databases when dealing with trade-ins.

Final group project pitch:
Brick & Mortar trade-in solution
Full Grip Games located in Akron, Ohio, has a website that is almost never up-to-date with Magic: The Gathering card stock status. This is counter-productive, as it is easier to check the stock than to travel to the store and ask if they have it in stock.

To solve this, I would like to build a section of their website for them that allows employees to record a stack of cards on the new page, and as they add a card name, they are given a clickable list of potential cards to add. Once the card name is decided upon, the user can select the Condition, Print, Set, and Foil/Non-foil details. The user would then click "Add to Trade-in", and the form would clear to accept the next card.

As the list is populated, a running total of Market Value for the entire list would be pulled from the Scryfall.io API. We would then adapt the trade-in value of (cash) 50% or (store-credit) 65%. If the customer is okay with the terms, we would click a button to confirm the trade-in. This action would then push the obtained cards into the database, updating it in real-time, solving the issue of a not-up-to-date stock information for customers.

Features required:
API Consumption
ASP.NET MVC
ASP.Net Core
ASP.NET Entity Framework
Database Queries / Updates
C#
Html
CSS
Javascript
We can also turn this into an SAAS to market to other locations.
